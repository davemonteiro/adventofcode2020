--- Day 7: Handy Haversacks ---

Summary:
You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it
looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently
delayed due to issues in luggage processing. Due to recent aviation
regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and
their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities
of other color-coded bags.

How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag?

--- Part Two ---

It's getting pretty expensive to fly these days - not because of ticket prices,
but because of the ridiculous number of bags you need to buy! Consider again
your shiny gold bag.

How many individual bags are required inside your single shiny gold bag?
